# Titanic Kaggle Competition Top 2%
This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive solution to the Kaggle competition, "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" The primary objective of this competition is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on attributes like passenger class, gender, age, etc. This is a binary classification problem. Through extensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, my goal is to create a high-performing model capable of providing precise predictions for whether a passenger survived the Titanic. I have evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tuned it to achieve the best possible results. Feel free to explore the notebook, understand the methodology, and experiment with different approaches to gain insights into the Titanic dataset and the machine learning process. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
