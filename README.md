# Titanic Kaggle Competition Top 2%
This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive solution to the Kaggle competition, "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" The primary objective of this competition is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on attributes like passenger class, gender, age, etc. This is a binary classification problem. Through extensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, my goal is to create a high-performing model capable of providing precise predictions for whether a passenger survived the Titanic. I have evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tuned it to achieve the best possible results. Feel free to explore the notebook, understand the methodology, and experiment with different approaches to gain insights into the Titanic dataset and the machine learning process. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

# Dataset Description
The dataset provides the ground truth label - whether each passenger survived or not, represented as 0 for no and 1 for yes. Each observation also contains attributes providing insights into the social status and privileges of each person on board:
- Pclass: The passenger's cabin class on the ship (1st, 2nd or 3rd class)
- Name: The name of the passenger
- Sex: Male or female
- Age: The age of the passenger
- SibSp: The number of siblings and spouses with the passenger
- Parch: The number of parents and children with the passenger
- Ticket: The ticket number
- Fare: How much the passenger paid for the ticket
- Cabin: Which cabin the passenger was allocated
- Embarked: Which port the passenger boarded from
